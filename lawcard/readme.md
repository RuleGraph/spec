**LawCard v0.2.1** is RuleGraph’s contract for “rules as data.” A card is a licensed, versioned JSON artifact that bundles: a typed set of **equations** (with **canonical rg-ast/v1.2**), **symbols and parameters** (with units/dimensions), validity assumptions, invariants, and open provenance. v0.2.1 adds optional equation IDs and atom-level AST hashes to support fine-grained referencing and integrity, a domain hint for symbol constraints, and a safer vendor-extension pattern—while keeping stability/test-vectors as first-class extensions. It’s **lean, verifiable, and built for composition**.
